# Godot Roguelike Tutorial

_Yet Another Roguelike Tutorial in Godot_

Every year the subreddit _r/roguelikedev_ does the "_Complete Roguelike Tutorial_", an event where participants go through a tutorial together over the course of several weeks. The tutorial in question is the one for python and the tcod library, found at http://rogueliketutorials.com/

This year (2023) I am attempting to accompany that tutorial with my own tutorial series for Godot 4. I finished the tutorial series mid December.


You can find the code for all parts here. This code should work with Godot 4.1 (and above).

# C# Version of the Code

[plyr0](https://github.com/plyr0) has made an effort to translate the code to C#, which you can find here: https://github.com/plyr0/Godot-Roguelike-Tutorial-CSharp
